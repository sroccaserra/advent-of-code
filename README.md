### Linux

- On Linux, `/usr/bin/time -v ...` gives the memory usage (see `Maximum
  resident set size`).

### Scheme

- Scheme is even smaller that Lua it seems, there is no regex utilities in the
  standard library for instance.
- Named `let` is useful for looping:
    - <http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs/r6rs-Z-H-14.html#node_sec_11.16>
- The `do` special form looks powerful:
    - <http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs-lib/r6rs-lib-Z-H-6.html>

### Lua

Lua is a simple and very small language, which is a nice feature because it is
one of the rare languages where you can read the entire doc in a reasonable
time.

The downside is that the standard library is limited, there is no tuples, no
sets, no class. We have to use what is provided in a creative way to emulate
those.

So in a way, it can be fun to try and be creative to "use what we have" and "do
what we can".

What we have is a very versatile "table" data structure, that can either be
used as a 1-based array or as a hash table, and functions. And while Lua also
provides "metatables", that can be used to emulate prototype-based inheritance,
I found it not really useful for Advent of Code puzzles, maybe I didn't look
hard enough.

Another problem is that not unlike JavaScript, Lua does not check function
arity, nil value bugs can sneak in very easily deep into a program. So we have
to be extra careful.

- Lua has no set of tuples and no set, but it can be faked with tables, for
  exemple:

```lua
t = {}
function add(t,x,y) if not t[y] then t[y] = {} end t[y][x] = true end
function has(t,x,y) if not t[y] then t[y] = {} end return t[y][x] end
```

- Lua cannot use tables or tuples as keys, but you can usually easily generate
  a key with `string.format()`, for example:

```lua
local key = string.format("%d %d %d %d", p1_pos, p1_score, p2_pos, p2_score)
```

- Use `t[y][x] = {}` to store data based on coordinates, like adjacency lists.

- Use `table.insert(t, x)` and `table.remove(t)` to implement an array-based
  stack with tables.

- Use `table.insert(t, 1, x)` and `table.remove(t, 1)` for small queues (up to
  some hundred elements).

### Python

- Python can now pattern match:
    - Structural Pattern Matching: Tutorial ~ <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0636/>
- Counters can be useful:
    - Counter objects ~ <https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#counter-objects>
- If I mute a matrix m (list of lists) copied with `m.copy()`, there is a good chance that I mute the original matrix also. `[r.copy() for r in m]` should work better. See also `copy.deepcopy()`.

### Haskell

- `Data.Set` can be used as a priority queue (`insert` and `deleteFindMin` are
  O(log n)) (see day 15).
- `flip (,) <$> [y-1..y+1] <*> [x-1..x+1]` generates `[(x-1, y-1), (x, y-1), (x+1, y-1) ...]`.
- We can pattern guard on monads with the `<-` operator : `validate xs (y:ys) | Just x <- lookup y brackets = validate (x:xs) ys`.
- Beware, if you want to update a count with -n `Map.insertWith (-)` will
  probably reverse the arguments. Use `flip (-)` or `(+) k (-n)`.

### Uxn

- Take great care with relative addresses. `#00 ,&a STR` works but `,&a #00 SWP STR` doesn't, because in the second case the relative address is measured from the wrong point.
- Use `STH` and `STHr` to move values to and from the return stack
- Use `LITr` to push values like `#00` to the return stack

## How to run

To run Python solutions:

```
$ python3 src/01.{py,in}
```

To run Haskell solutions (two ways):

```
$ stack runhaskell src/01.hs
$ stack runhaskell src/01.{hs,in}
```

To run Lua solutions:

```
$ lua src/01.{lua,in}
```

To run Lua tests (requires busted, `luarocks install --local busted`):
```
$ busted -o TAP src
```

To run Scheme solutions:

```
$ scheme --libdirs src --script src/01.{ss,in}
```

To run uxn solutions:

```
$ make 01
```

To run Elixir solutions:

```
$ elixir src/01.exs <src/01.in
```

To run Go solutions:

```
$ go run src/01.{go,in}
```

To run Forth solutions:

```
$ gforth src/01.{fs,in}
```

## How it started

```shell
$ stack new aoc2021
$ cd aoc2021
$ rm -r app
$ rm -r test
$ rm -r Changelog.md
```

In package.yaml:
- Remove "executables" section
- Remove "tests" section
- add hspec dependency (LTS) and -W ghc-option in "library" section

```shell
$ stack setup
$ stack build
```

Then write a Spec.hs file in src, and try to run it with:
```shell
$ stack runhaskell -- src/Spec.hs
```

Note: for this simple project, I want all the code in the src directory.
